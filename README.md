# Login Practice

### Purpose
This project was a jump into the world of sessions and cookies. It has very basic login, logout, and authorization functionality. My main takeaway on this project was how to work with sessions. I have created a sessions controller with actions, new, create, and destroy to handle user logins. I hope to come back to this project and add encryption functionality to the storage of passwords.
